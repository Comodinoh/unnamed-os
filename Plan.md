# About me
Hello, I'm a first year CS student from Romania that wants to try his hands at creating a kernel. I have a passion for low-level programming and I'm interested in Operating systems and Computer architecture.

## Environment
I mostly develop on Linux, on the GNU Emacs editor. If I am on windows I will most probably use Visual Studio.
I periodically save my config changes in my [stuff](https://github.com/Comodinoh/stuff.git) repository.

# About the project
This is a personal passion project.
I am planning for this operating system to, at the very least, support x86 architecture CPUs. The kernel itself will probably be somewhat Unix compliant, I will take some things from Unix but I also plan to do some things different.

This project is in its infancy, in fact it hasn't even taken its first steps; I have yet to decide on a language to implement it in and I still have tons to document myself about. That means nothing is set in stone yet and everything is subject to change for now, including API design.
To develop and learn about Operating Systems I am using [this](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) guide here.
I understand this is a massive project that will take a long time, as such please have patience with me.

## Language
Currently considering using and learning Rust for implementations.

## Schedule
I plan to only work on this project during weekends (Sat-Sun) and to only allocate no more than 3 hours (Usually in the morning) of my freetime per day.
I am a student and I don't want this to conflict with my studying and schedule during university, so there might be times where I work less and times where I work more.

## Versioning
I plan to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Contributing 
Anyone is allowed to contribute, as long as it aligns with the license. I will take my time to check out contributions so they might be slow.

## Contacting
If you wanna contact me just do so, be it email, discord or anything else.

# Licensing
I haven't decided what license to use yet.
